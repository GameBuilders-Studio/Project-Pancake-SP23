# Project-Pancake-SP22

The GameBuilders Studio project for Spring 2023!

WRITE GITHUB GUIDELINES HERE

The remote branch named "main" will contain the most up-to-date version of the project. When assigned a task, you will create a new branch off of development and do your work there. Do not branch off anything other than development.

IMPORTANT: To avoid merge conflicts, NEVER use the main scene or someone else's test scenes to create or experiment with assets. Create a new scene in Assets/Scenes/Test and title it TEST_PurposeOfScene. For instance, if I'm tasked with creating explosive environmental objects, I might make a scene called TEST_ExplosiveEnvironmentObjects. 

If you removed a file, use "rm" instead of "add". If you don't know what files you added/removed/modified, run "git status" and see what's under "untracked files" (these are new files you created) and "changes not staged for commit" (previously existing files you modified or deleted). Only add the changes among these that you deliberately made.

Commit messages should summarize all changes made. They should not describe the state of the code, (i.e. “flying enemy second version”). They should stand alone, so anyone could read just the message and have a general idea of what changes are contained in it:

Once you're completely finished working, push your changes on your local branch to the remote version of that branch (DON'T PUSH TO DEVELOPMENT!)

You'll get a link to create a merge request (to merge your branch into development). Follow it to create the request with a detailed description of your changes.

Once your branch has been merged, do not continue working on it. Switch back to development and make a new branch.

Branch names follow this pattern:
<type of branch>/<branch title>
feat/player/easier-wall-jump
bug/level-design/music-duplication
art/ui/new-selection-sprites
